For unordered graph: 
     Size of the factor     = 29
     Size of fill           = 8
     Amount of work (flops) = 114

For permuted graph: 
     Size of the factor     = 26
     Size of fill           = 5
     Amount of work (flops) = 90

For graph with etree: 
     Size of the factor     = 26
     Size of fill           = 5
     Amount of work (flops) = 90
